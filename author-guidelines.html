                           <p><h4>Ethics of Publication and Statement of Malpractice</h4></p>
                            <p>MedDocs Publications have a very strict checking system of the submitted manuscripts. All manuscripts are being checked by the panels of editors and then peer-reviewed to determine the quality of the contents. Copying without stating sources and duplication are considered to be unethical and on such instances all such submitted manuscripts are straight away rejected.</p>
                          <p><h4>Article Processing Charges </h4></p>
<p>MedDocs Publishers do not receive any funding or compensation from any government body or institution.

This being an open access journals and ebooks, there are no subscription charges being collected from the readers. The readers can enjoy free access of our journals and ebooks online. This is to be clarified that there are no charges for the submission of the manuscripts.

We also get several corporate and academic bodies as sponsors in our conferences that we organize from time to time. </p>
<p><h4>Submission of an Article </h4></p>
<p>There are several manuscripts being submitted every day for our consideration. So, this is a tedious duty at our end as well. So, in order to avoid long delays we suggest the authors should adhere to the length, level and the format as suggested by MedDocs Publishers at every stage for quick and convenient processing and also to avoid rejection. <p>
<p>Every submitted article should necessarily have a 300 words summary or abstract (except for the letter to editors and clinical image submissions) which is separate from the main text. The summary is to be very carefully written and should clearly give a brief account of the entire work. It should necessarily contain the purpose of the study and the major methodologies adopted while conducting the research and very clearly highlighting all the major findings of the study. The main body text should ideally have sub-headings of each not exceeding 40 characters. </p>

<p><h4>Case Study/Report</h4></p>
<p>Case studies are being published with the aim to add several additional information that are related to the investigative research on the topic of interest. </p>
<p>The case studies usually add a lot of value to the main articles or contents that are being submitted and throws a lot of light on the key insights of the concerned core area. The case reports are generally brief and sought to follow a clear format for the convenience of the readers. </p>

<p><h4>Editorials </h4></p>
<p>The editorials are generally commentaries on the published issue of the publication. The Editorial office of MedDocs Publishers approach for the application for this profile and the authors who are interested in this are generally required to submit their applications before the provided deadline. </p>
<p><h4>Clinical Images</h4></p> 
<p>The clinical images are nothing but the very organized pictorial depictions of certain chosen topic. This should not exceed five figures with their proper description and the description should not exceed 300 words. No citations or references are being stated for clinical images. However, if required you may mention the references and this should not exceed more than three in number. </p>
<p><h4>Acknowledgement </h4></p>
<p>This particular section is the mention of the grant details, people and funds that are involved in the creation of the literary work</p>
<p><h4>References </h4></p>
<p>This is to be noted that only the accepted and published manuscripts are to be included in the reference list. The conference talks, meeting extracts or papers submitted that are not accepted for publishing are not to be mentioned in the references under any circumstances. Authors are being directed to provide an online link for every reference as they could be published online. </p>

<p><h4>Tables </h4></p>
<p>The tables are to be used at a minimum and if used should be designed in a very simple manner. In case it is very necessary to insert a table in your content, the authors should necessarily submit the tables only in .doc format. This is to be kept in mind that the tables are to be typed double-spaced throughout which also is applicable for the headings and footnotes. Every table inserted in the content should be on separate pages and should be numbered properly. Every table should necessarily have a heading as well as a legend. The tables should necessarily be self-explanatory with any reference to the text. The various details of the methods of experimentation are being described in the legend instead of explaining them in textual format. </p>

<p><h4>Figures </h4></p>
<p>There are preferred file formats for the representation of the photographic images like JPEG, GIF, TIFF formats. If you have the images in some other formats, then you may send us the Photoshop files and we would do the required modifications at our end. 
All images should be above the intended display size with image resolutions of the following dimensions: Line Art 800 dpi, Combination of Line Art and Halftone of 600 dpi, Halftone of 300 dpi. </p>
<p><h4>Proofs and Reprints</h4></p> 
<p>The electronic proofs are being sent as an e-mail attachment to the corresponding writer or author as a PDF file. Page proofs are being considered to be the final version of the submitted manuscript and authors are requested to mark the changes (if any) in the PDF. Hard copies of the published manuscripts can also be obtained from our editorial office on special request. </p>
<p><h4>Copyright</h4></p>
